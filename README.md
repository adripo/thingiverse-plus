## Update

By default, update is automatic and nothing has to be done.

The userscript is setup to be auto-updated via metadata-block.

If you don't get new versions, make sure your script manager checks for updates or setup it to do it automatically.


## Usage

After installing an additional button with `T+` will appear at the bottom right of the page.

When clicked, the settings menu is displayed and you can enable any of the available features.

Enjoy!
